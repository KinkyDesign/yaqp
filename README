About
==================================================================================
This project (YAQP) is developed under OpenTox (http://opentox.org) 
to serve as a web service for QSAR model training and validation. 
The service runs at http://opentox.ntua.gr:3000/ as a standalone application, 
but you can also download and compile the source code and run it locally. 
Three external java libraries are needed in order to compile the 
source code: Restlet, Weka & LibSVM. All of these libraries are open-source 
and distributed for free.

Enjoy YAQP !
