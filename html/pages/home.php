			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p align="justify"> Predictive Toxicology is a meeting point for Toxicology, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Mathematics. Its aim is to reveal the underlying molecular patterns that lead to toxic and/or in general adverse effects (as well as healing effects) of a chemical substance to the human body and the ecosystem. The construction of mathematical models which correlate molecular characteristics (known as molecular descriptors) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"><em>in vitro</em></a> experimental data, with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity">toxicity</a> of each substance will result to the <b><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6361872964130308142">stopping of animal testing</a></b> and will boost the prolificacy of the research towards new drugs. Eventually the counter-scientific and so-called "inevitable" administration of toxic substances on animals for the virtue of drug discovery, can and must be substituted by computer simulations, followed by <em>in vitro</em> experiments and finally clinical trials.

Extensive research work on machine learning algorithms has shed much light in the unexplored field of predictive toxicology. Classification and Regression Models be trained and evaluated by means of existing data. These models can then be useful as predictive tools for certain toxicological property of a given chemical compound. P-values, Confidence Intervals or other statistics are calculated so that one can know how reliable the result is. The problem of the suitability of a certain model for the prediction of a property of a given substabce, naturally arises. So, every model should be accompanied by an evaluation for its applicability domain. Various algorithms for the calculation of such a domain have been proposed. Hence for a given compound, a suitable model (or a set of suitable models) among a set of trained models can be chosen, and a toxicological property can be predictided with known uncertainty. The aforementioned functionalities are offered as web services from this site. Follow the link <a href="./index.php?p=webservices">web services</a> to see a list of the already implemented services.
<br/><br/>
This site offers predictive toxicology Web-based Services. It is 100% open to the general public, free and open-source. The user can build <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~joseph/support-vector-machines4.pdf">SVM</a> (Support Vector Machines) classifiers and regressors as well as other models, validate them with available data and perform predictions on sets of given data.</p>
